## Day 1 - Python Basics & Data Science

### 1. Python Basics - Number Guessing Game

#### Objective:
Build a simple **number guessing game** using Python.

#### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Variables**: A variable is a container for storing data values. In Python, you can create variables to store different data types, such as integers, strings, or lists.
- **Functions**: Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. We define functions using the `def` keyword in Python.
- **User Input**: User input allows us to take information from the user. In Python, we use the `input()` function to get data from the user.
- **Loops**: A loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times. In our game, we use a loop to keep asking the user for a guess until they get the correct answer.
- **Conditionals**: Conditionals allow us to make decisions in code. We use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute certain blocks of code based on conditions.

#### Code Example:
```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
number = random.randint(1, 100)

# Take user input
guess = int(input("Guess the number between 1 and 100: "))

# Repeat until the guess is correct
while guess != number:
    if guess < number:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > number:
        print("Too high!")
    guess = int(input("Guess again: "))

print("Congratulations, you guessed it!")
```

### 2. Data Analysis with Pandas

#### Objective:
Learn how to create and manipulate datasets using **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data analysis.

#### Key Concepts Covered:
- **DataFrame**: A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas. Itâ€™s like a table with rows and columns where we can store and manipulate data. Itâ€™s one of the most common structures used in data analysis with Pandas.
  
- **Adding New Columns**: In Pandas, new columns can be added to a DataFrame by assigning values to new column names. This is useful for manipulating or adding calculated data to the dataset.
  
- **Filtering Data**: Filtering allows us to select data based on specific conditions. For example, we can filter out rows where the age of people is greater than 25.
  
- **Sorting Data**: Sorting allows us to reorder the data in a DataFrame based on a particular column, either in ascending or descending order.
  
- **Summarizing Data**: The `describe()` method in Pandas provides a summary of the statistics of numerical columns in a DataFrame. It includes metrics like mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
  
- **Getting Information About Data**: The `info()` method provides basic information about a DataFrame such as the number of rows, column names, and data types of the columns.

#### Code Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a simple DataFrame
data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], "Age": [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Add a new column 'Salary'
df["Salary"] = [50000, 60000, 70000]

# Filter rows where Age is greater than 25
df_filtered = df[df["Age"] > 25]

# Display summary statistics for numerical columns
print(df.describe())

# Display detailed information about the DataFrame
print(df.info())
```

### 3. Data Visualization with Matplotlib

#### Objective:
Learn how to visualize data using simple plots with **Matplotlib**, a popular Python plotting library.

#### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Plotting**: Plotting is the process of creating visual representations of data. In Matplotlib, we use functions like `plt.bar()` or `plt.plot()` to create plots. These visualizations help us understand patterns and trends in data more easily.
  
- **Customizing Plots**: Customizing plots means adding labels, titles, and other elements to improve readability. We can set the x and y axis labels, add a title, and more to make the plot clearer and more informative.
  
- **Types of Plots**: Matplotlib supports a variety of plots like line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and more. For this exercise, we focus on creating a **bar plot** to visualize data.

#### Code Example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create a simple DataFrame
data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], "Age": [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a bar plot
plt.bar(df["Name"], df["Age"])

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Name')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('Age of People')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

# Day 2 â€“ Python Basics and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Objective
Today, we focused on the **basics of Python programming**, including data structures like **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **sets**, as well as learning about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

---

### 1. Python Data Structures

#### Lists
- Lists are ordered collections that can hold items of different data types. They are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.
  
#### Tuples
- Tuples are similar to lists but are **immutable**, meaning once defined, their contents cannot be changed.

#### Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. The keys are unique, and they are used to store and retrieve values.

#### Sets
- Sets are unordered collections that only contain unique items. They are used to store elements without duplication.

---

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

#### Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. 
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

#### Encapsulation
- It is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a class. We use **private variables** (prefix with underscore) to hide details.

#### Inheritance
- Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). The child class can override the inherited methods.

#### Polymorphism
- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It also refers to the ability to override methods in child classes.



## Day 3 - Understanding AI Concepts & Machine Learning Algorithms

## Objective

Today, we explored fundamental AI concepts and different types of machine learning algorithms. Understanding these concepts is crucial as they form the foundation for building AI models.

### 1. Introduction to AI Concepts

**What is Artificial Intelligence?**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

**Key AI Concepts**:

**Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables machines to learn patterns from data.

**Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables machines to understand and generate human language.

**Computer Vision**: Allows machines to interpret and process images and videos.

### 2. Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning can be categorized into three main types:

#### 1. Supervised Learning

The model learns from labeled data.

Example algorithms:

##### Linear Regression

**What it does**:

Used for predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock prices).
Finds the best-fit line between input (X) and output (Y).
**How it works**:

The equation of a line: **Y = mX + b**
The algorithm finds the best values for m (slope) and b (intercept) that minimize errors.
ðŸ“Œ Example: Predict house prices based on square footage.

##### Logistic Regression

**What it does**:

Used for binary classification (e.g., Spam or Not Spam, Disease or No Disease).
Instead of predicting a number, it predicts probabilities between 0 and 1.
**How it works**:

Uses the sigmoid function to map outputs between 0 and 1.
If probability > 0.5 â†’ Class 1
If probability < 0.5 â†’ Class 0
ðŸ“Œ Example: Predict whether a student will pass an exam based on study hours.

##### Decision Trees
**What it does**:

Works like a flowchart: "If X happens, then do Y"
Used for both classification and regression problems.
**How it works**:

Splits the dataset into smaller groups based on feature importance.
Each node represents a decision rule, and leaves represent predictions.
ðŸ“Œ Example: Classify whether an email is spam based on words it contains.


**Random Forest**

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

**Neural Networks**

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning

The model finds patterns in unlabeled data.

Example algorithms:

##### K-Means Clustering :
**What it does**:

Unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping data into clusters.
Used in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, etc.
**How it works**:

Selects K cluster centers randomly.
Assigns each data point to the nearest cluster.
Updates cluster centers and repeats until convergence.
ðŸ“Œ Example: Group customers based on shopping behavior.

**Hierarchical Clustering**

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

**Autoencoders**

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning

The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Example algorithms:

##### Q-Learning :

**What it does**:

Reinforcement Learning algorithm where an agent learns by interacting with an environment.
Used in **game AI, robotics, self-driving cars**.
**How it works**:

The AI takes actions, receives rewards, and updates its Q-values.
It learns the best actions over time to maximize rewards.
ðŸ“Œ Example: AI learns to play a simple grid-based game.
